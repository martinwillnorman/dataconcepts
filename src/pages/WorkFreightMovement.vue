            <ul data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="600" data-aos-delay="100">
              <li>- Analyze detailed business requirements to model the current and projected future demands of the FEMA missions.</li>
              <li>- Implement the business needs through a new enterprise web application using Java and latest technologies like Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Framework, Maven, OpenJPA, JMS, AJAX, JSP, log4j, PDF and Excel open source frameworks, and WebSphere Distributed Cache.</li>
              <li>- Develop an Application Dashboard with real-time details about each deployed resource.</li>
              <li>- For data privacy, deploy the application using database and application server instance installed in an on-premise infrastructure.</li>
              <li>- Implement Spring Security to manage user authentication and authorization using on-premise Active Directory.</li>
              <li>- Provide high availability and scalability by deploying the web application in a clustered WebSphere v8.0 ND environment installed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</li>
              <li>- For deployment automation, use Maven to generate enterprise application archive files and integrate it with Jenkins for build automation and automated deployments to the target application server.</li>
              <li>- Simulate 10 parallel high traffic missions using HP Load Runner to load test the application.</li>
