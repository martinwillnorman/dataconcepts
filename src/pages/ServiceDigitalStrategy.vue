It changes the mindset from thinking of projects as discreet events to thinking of them as part of a greater journey toward a more responsive and efficient organization. Organizations that adopt agility as a core strategic tenet worry about the basic underlying assets that allow them to iterate and learn faster. They invest in enabling capabilities that many organizations see as high cost with uncertain returns. Agile organizations realize these investments un-bottleneck everything they do, and create byproducts from ongoing projects that make future change faster and easier."
