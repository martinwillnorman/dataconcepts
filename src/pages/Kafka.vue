Now imagine getting those insights in real time! We are talking about a process that gives you instant information about an active transaction. Such information is always valuable, isn't it? Companies who often deal with Big Data have massive databases and millions or billions of files they are processing. Data streaming, as the name implies, is a stream or flow of raw data that is captured from multiple sources and sent for processing continuously. Analyzing and processing such data streams makes an organization more efficient and opens up new opportunities."
