            >The company turned to Data Concepts to overhaul their entire approach to data, which included migrating their on-premise systems to the cloud and transforming from a B2B to a DTC model. The firm lacked an enterprise-wide data strategy, which hindered their ability to use member and policyholder data to personalize the customer experience. In particular, they suffered from siloed data systems that were difficult to integrate, manage and support. Inconsistent data definitions and the absence of cohesive data governance meant that mission-critical reports were unaligned with business needs.</p>

We defined the reference architecture for a cloud data lake, their new analytics platform, as well as tools for analysts to develop and execute models, perform data discovery activities and create visualizations. With the data environment established, we operationalized its capabilities by using call center data to capture, enrich and prioritize marketing leads. Lastly, we created analytics and innovation sandboxes to allow data scientists to quickly build models and score them against full datasets.</p>

              <li>- New data could become incorporated and used with little to no processing or uptime.</li>
