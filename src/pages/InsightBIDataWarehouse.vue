We perform ETL/BI platform conversion to newer platforms by redefining the architecture if required, converting applications and enabling migration to production. Our methodology ensures that business is aligned to this change and begins to adopt the newer technology with ease."

In a few instances, the ETL and BI versions are outdated and no more supported by product vendors. We offer services on upgrading the existing ETL and BI platforms with newer versions by redefining the architecture if required, upgrading the applications and facilitating migration to production. With zero business disruption, we ensure that various environments like development, test and production movement of the upgraded application are carried out smoothly."

            content="With high adoption of BI over the years, we understand that different departments in an organization might have developed their own BI applications, leaving them with a lot of redundant BI applications. The greater challenge is that these departments refer to different sources of data and present the same information differently. There are instances where different technologies are used. We assist organizations in BI consolidation and rationalization on a single technology. We also help in decommissioning the old BI application and hold the older reports in an archive environment that can be leveraged if necessary."
